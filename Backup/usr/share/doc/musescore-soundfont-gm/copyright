This package was debianized by Toby Smithe <tsmithe@ubuntu.com> on
Thu, 22 Nov 2007 17:49:27 +0000.

It was downloaded from <http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mscore> and
repackaged as a gzipped tarball, with the mscore/mscore/data/piano1.sf2
soundfont ("Gort's MiniPiano", which is non-free) and some files removed to
sustain DFSG; see the get-orig-source rule and README.Debian for specifics.
